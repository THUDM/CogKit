# Introduction

CogKit is an open-source project that provides a user-friendly interface for researchers and developers to utilize ZhipuAI's [CogView](https://huggingface.co/collections/THUDM/cogview-67ac3f241eefad2af015669b) (image generation) and [CogVideoX](https://huggingface.co/collections/THUDM/cogvideo-66c08e62f1685a3ade464cce) (video generation) models. It streamlines multimodal tasks such as text-to-image(T2I), text-to-video(T2V), and image-to-video(I2V). Users must comply with legal and ethical guidelines to ensure responsible implementation.
